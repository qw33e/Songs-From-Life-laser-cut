# Songs-From-Life-laser-cut
The files necessary to cut the Songs From Life record with a laser cutter

This repository contains both the pdf and svg of sides 1 and 2 of the record, and need only to be run on a laser cutter with dimensions fitting the record (12in)
The files were created used Amanda Ghassaei's LaserCutRecord python program, available here:
